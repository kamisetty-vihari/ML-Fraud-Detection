# ML-Fraud-Detection



This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning.

## Key Features
- Cleaned and analyzed a large financial dataset
- Used feature engineering to detect unusual balance behavior
- Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance
- Trained a Random Forest model with high recall and ROC-AUC
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
- Recall (fraud): 99%
- ROC-AUC: 0.998
